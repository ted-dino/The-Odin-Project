    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Mascarpone makes this cheesy pasta 
        extra creamy, and the addition of 
        potato starch means the sauce thickens 
        without flour.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients (recipe yields 6 servings)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces gluten-free pasta (such as Barilla)</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup potato starch</li>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>⅓ cup mascarpone cheese/li>
        <li>3 dashes hot sauce (such as Tabasco) (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water 
            to a boil. Cook pasta in the boiling water, 
            stirring occasionally until tender yet firm 
            to the bite, about 7 minutes. Drain and 
            reserve 1/2 cup cooking liquid. Transfer 
            pasta to a serving bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; 
            add onion and cook until translucent, 
            about 3 minutes. Stir potato starch into 
            onion mixture until dissolved, about 
            1 minute. Slowly pour evaporated milk into 
            onion mixture and stir constantly. 
            Bring sauce to a simmer and remove saucepan 
            from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir Cheddar cheese, mascarpone cheese, 
            and hot sauce into sauce until smooth, 
            adding the reserved pasta cooking liquid 
            if needed to thin the sauce. The cheese 
            sauce should be the consistency of gravy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix cheese sauce into pasta and 
            serve while warm and gooey.
        </li>
    </ol>
