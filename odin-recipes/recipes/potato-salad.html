    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of salted water to
            a boil. Add potatoes and cook until 
            tender but still firm, about 15 
            minutes. Drain, cool, peel and 
            chop.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place eggs in a saucepan and cover 
            with cold water. Bring water to a 
            boil; cover, remove from heat, and 
            let eggs stand in hot water for 10 
            to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water,
            cool, peel and chop.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, combine the potatoes, 
            eggs, celery, onion, relish, garlic 
            salt, celery salt, mustard, pepper and 
            mayonnaise. Mix together well and 
            refrigerate until chilled.
