### The challenge

  - For this project you’ll be creating an entire web page from a design we’ll provide for you. If you’ve been following along you should have the skills you need to accomplish this, but it may not be easy!

    The design we’re providing you comes in the form of 2 images, one of them an image of the complete website, and one with some details about some of the fonts and colors we’ve used.
    
### Links

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

By doing this I learned more about Flexbox.

### Continued development

As always, in the future I will make more responsive and improve the design.
